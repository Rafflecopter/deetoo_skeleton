deetoo_skeleton
===============

Don't fork this directly, as you're only allowed one fork of any repo.

Instead, start a new repo and add this as upstream:

```bash
$ git remote add skeleton git@github.com:Rafflecopter/deetoo_skeleton.git
```

Then, pull it down:

```bash
$ git pull skeleton master
```
